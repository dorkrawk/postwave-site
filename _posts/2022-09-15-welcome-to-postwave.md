**Welcome!**

Postwave is a flat file based blogging system that lets you write posts staticly and display them dynamically.

This blog is meant to serve as an example implementation to help you understand how to work with Postwave. Check out the code for this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/dorkrawk/postwave-site) and feel free to use it as the basis for your own sites.

To learn more check out the [Postwave repo](https://github.com/dorkrawk/postwave)

If you want to just start using it, it's available on [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/postwave).
