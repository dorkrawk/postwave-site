**What happens if I use the same post title on the same day?**

`postwave build` will handle this just fine. It will rename your files `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` and `yyyy-mm-dd-title-1.md`.

**What happens if I use non alphanumeric characters in my post title?**

[You tell me](../posts/q--a)

**Can Postwave generate an RSS feed?**

It [sure can](../rss)!

**Will updating the post title update the slug (and path) for the post?**

Yep, so be careful if you're worried about an update breaking links to an old post.

If you want to freeze the slug you can use the `frozen_slug: slug-you-want` field in the post header.

**Will updating the post date update the slug (and path) for the post?**

Nope, but it will update the Markdown file name.

**Why the name "Postwave"?**

I'm a big fan of the [Blue Meanies](https://bluemeanies.bandcamp.com/album/the-post-wave).

**Seriously, another blog engine? WHY?!**

Honestly, it scratches an itch I have. I wanted to write posts in a specific way and then build them into my site, rather than have my site be bolted on to a pre-built blog. After years of hacking together similar solutions with things like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I just built what I wanted. Maybe other people will find it useful, too!

**So who built this?**
